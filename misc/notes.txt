Player data structure considerations
- resource cards in hand
- dev cards in hand
- used dev cards (discarded but still associated with player)
  * can be used to count knights
- has longest road?
- has largest army?
- victory points
- how many settlements available?
- how many cities available?
- how many roads available?
- trade capabilities (e.g. 3:1 harbor, resource-specific 2:1 harbor(s))

Game state data structures
- Board
  * location of robber! (not added yet)
- resource decks
- dev card deck

USE XML FOR STUFF?????
